Greetings!  My Name is **Eli Paster** and I am a Researcher at Syracuse University and I am tasked with assisting in the processes of studying the dynamics of protein behavior
and how it relates to biomechanics.  With this main goal in mind, I have selected to specialize in key aspects of this field through:

1.  Gathering knowledge of [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

2.  Research and Experimentation of *OD* [(Optical Density)](https://www.safeopedia.com/definition/7714/optical-density-od)

3.  Finding new and efficent ways of automating different processes of the protein production procedure of the lab

For more information click [here](https://jmfrancklab.github.io/AAResearch.html) to visit the home page of my affiliated lab and explore the amazing world of biotechnology!  This page will be used as a place to update supporters on my progress
and also hopfully be a place to bounce ideas of of each other.  Thank you for your time and I am thrilled to begin this project!
